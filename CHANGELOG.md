# Changelog

All notable changes to `10xgraph-api` (formerly `10xscale-agentflow-cli`) are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Compatibility policy

- **Nothing public is removed without a deprecation cycle.** A public name (anything
  exported from `tenxgraph_api`, a CLI command or flag, an HTTP route, or a
  `10xgraph.json` key) is first marked deprecated in a release, kept working for at
  least one subsequent minor release, and only then removed in a major release.
- **Moved modules keep a back-compat shim** re-exporting from the new location for at
  least one minor release. Import paths do not break silently.
- **Breaking changes are documented under a `### Breaking` heading** in the release's
  section, with the migration step spelled out.
- Anything under `tenxgraph_api.cli.templates/` is emitted scaffolding, not API; template
  content can change in any release.

---

## [0.7.0] - Unreleased

**First release as `10xgraph-api`.** 10xScale Agentflow is now 10xGraph. This package
replaces `10xscale-agentflow-cli`; the server, the CLI and the HTTP API are unchanged apart
from the names below. The old package import, command, config file name and env vars keep
working until 2.0.

### Changed

- **PyPI package `10xscale-agentflow-cli` is now `10xgraph-api`.** Uninstall the old package
  and the old core first: `pip uninstall 10xscale-agentflow-cli 10xscale-agentflow`, then
  `pip install 10xgraph-api`.
- **Import package `agentflow_cli` is now `tenxgraph_api`** (`from tenxgraph_api import
  BaseAuth`). `agentflow_cli` stays as a deprecated alias that resolves to the same module
  objects and emits a `DeprecationWarning` once.
- **The command is `10xgraph`.** `agentflow` is kept as a deprecated alias that prints a
  one-line notice to stderr and runs the same CLI.
- **The config file is `10xgraph.json`.** `agentflow.json` is still read when no
  `10xgraph.json` sits in the same directory; when both exist, `10xgraph.json` wins. This
  applies to the CLI (`api`, `play`, `dev`, `audit`, `config`, `eval`, `test`) and to the
  server started without `GRAPH_PATH` (for example from the generated Dockerfile).
  `10xgraph api` notes when it loaded the legacy name. `10xgraph init` writes
  `10xgraph.json`. `10xgraph config` always edits `10xgraph.json`: when only
  `agentflow.json` exists it opens prefilled from that file, and the first save creates
  `10xgraph.json` without touching `agentflow.json`.
- **Core dependency is `10xgraph>=0.10.1,<2.0`** (import `tenxgraph`), replacing
  `10xscale-agentflow`. Do not install both: each ships an `agentflow` module.
- **CLI env vars use the `TENXGRAPH_` prefix:** `TENXGRAPH_NO_FULLSCREEN`,
  `TENXGRAPH_NO_SPINNER`, `TENXGRAPH_ASCII`. The `AGENTFLOW_` names are read when the new
  variable is unset.
- **Uploaded media is referenced as `graph://media/<key>`**, matching the core. Client
  input using `agentflow://media/<key>` still resolves, and both forms go through the same
  ownership check.
- **Default `MEDIA_CLOUD_PREFIX` is `10xgraph-media`.** With the default, the core still
  reads objects stored under `agentflow-media`; an explicitly set prefix is used as is.
- **The WebSocket bearer subprotocol is `10xgraph-bearer`.** `agentflow-bearer`, which
  released clients send, is still accepted and echoed back.
- **The bundled skill installs as `10xgraph`** (`.claude/skills/10xgraph`,
  `.agents/skills/10xgraph`, `.github/skills/10xgraph`) and the Copilot instructions file as
  `10xgraph.instructions.md`. Earlier `agentflow` skill folders are left in place; delete
  them after installing the new one.
- **Logger names moved to `tenxgraph_api.*`** (from `agentflow-cli.*`, `agentflow_api.*` and
  `agentflowcli`). Update any logging config that targets the old names.
- The default Redis rate-limit key prefix is `10xgraph:rate-limit` (was
  `agentflow:rate-limit`). Counters restart once on upgrade; a configured `prefix` is kept.
- The config editor's session header is `X-10xGraph-Token`.
- **`10xgraph build` Dockerfiles ship only what the server runs.** After installing
  dependencies, the image deletes the CLI-only `tenxgraph_api/cli/templates` (project
  scaffolds, bundled skill) and `tenxgraph_api/cli/config_editor` (the local HTML/JS editor).
  The generated `.dockerignore` also leaves out `tests/`, `evals/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`
  and `.github/`. Regenerate the Dockerfile with `10xgraph build --force` to pick this up.

  [github.com/10xGraph/10xgraph-api](https://github.com/10xGraph/10xgraph-api); docs at
  [10xgraph.com](https://10xgraph.com).

### Unchanged on purpose

- Error code `AGENTFLOW_VALIDATION_ERROR` and the `agentflow.cli/v1` schema id in
  `--format json` output, so clients and scripts that match on them keep working.
- CLI error codes (`AF-*`).

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-07

**Final release of `10xscale-agentflow-cli`.** Agentflow is now 10xGraph
([10xgraph.com](https://10xgraph.com), [github.com/10xGraph](https://github.com/10xGraph)).
No further versions will be published under this name; the API server and CLI continue
as `10xgraph-api`. Installed copies keep working, and `10xscale-agentflow-cli==0.6.0`
can be pinned.

### Added

- **AG-UI endpoint (`POST /v1/ag-ui`)** serves the graph over the
  [AG-UI protocol](https://docs.ag-ui.com), so AG-UI clients such as CopilotKit
  (through its generic `HttpAgent`) can use an Agentflow agent. Off by default: set
  `"ag_ui": {"enabled": true}` in `agentflow.json` and install the new `ag-ui` extra
  (`pip install "10xscale-agentflow-cli[ag-ui]"`, `ag-ui-protocol>=1.0,<2`). The server
  refuses to start with a clear install hint when the endpoint is enabled but the package
  is missing. The route uses the `graph:stream` permission and checks `threadId`
  ownership when auth is configured. Streams text and reasoning, tool calls and results,
  node steps, application state (`STATE_SNAPSHOT`), and `interrupt()` pauses (`RUN_FINISHED`
  with an `interrupt` outcome, answered through `RunAgentInput.resume`; `cancelled` resumes
  with `None`). The thread's checkpoint is the record of the conversation, so only new user
  messages and tool results from the client reach the graph. Browser tools the client sends
  (`RunAgentInput.tools`, e.g. CopilotKit `useFrontendTool`) are offered to the model for that
  run with no `agentflow.json` entry. `RunAgentInput.context`, `tools` and `forwardedProps`
  are available to nodes as `config["ag_ui"]`. `agentflow init` writes
  `"ag_ui": {"enabled": false}`, and `agentflow config` shows the new section. Requires
  `10xscale-agentflow>=0.10.0` (`interrupt()` and per-run `remote_tools`).
- **`resume` on `/v1/graph/invoke` and `/v1/graph/stream`.** Resumes a thread paused by
  `interrupt()`; `messages` may be empty when `resume` is sent.
- **`remote_tools` is a server-owned run-config key.** Client config can no longer set it on
  any route; only adapters whose clients bring tools by protocol (AG-UI) fill it.
- `GraphService.stream_chunks()` yields the graph stream as `StreamChunk` objects, with an
  optional `server_config` for server-owned run config; `stream_graph()` (NDJSON) is now a
  thin wrapper over it.
- **`agentflow skills --validate PATH`** checks a skill directory, or a folder of
  skill directories, against the Agent Skills specification (agentskills.io).
  It reports errors and warnings per skill and exits `1` when any skill is
  invalid. The option is repeatable, and it requires `10xscale-agentflow>=0.10.0`
  (`agentflow.core.skills.validate_skill`).
- **The bundled Agentflow skill conforms to the Agent Skills specification.** Its
  `description` was invalid YAML (an unquoted `TRIGGER when:`), so strict parsers,
  including Agentflow's own loader, rejected it. Codex, Claude and GitHub now all
  receive one identical `SKILL.md` that references `references/...` relative to
  the skill directory, instead of three copies hard-wired to one install path
  each.
- **`agentflow config` opens a browser editor for `agentflow.json`.** Optional sections
  (auth, authorization, rate limiting, observability, ...) can be switched on or off and
  filled in, validated without saving, and saved. Saving is blocked while there are errors,
  writes are atomic, key order is preserved, and the previous file is kept as
  `agentflow.json.bak`. Options: `-c/--config`, `--port`, `--no-open`.
- **`remote_tools` in `agentflow.json`.** Trusted schemas for tools executed by clients,
  attached to the graph at startup.
- **`websocket.max_connections_per_user`** caps how many concurrent WebSocket connections one
  verified user may hold.
- **`rate_limit.trusted_proxies`.** When set, `X-Forwarded-For` is honoured only for requests
  whose peer address is in one of the listed IPs or CIDR ranges.

### Changed

- **Requires `10xscale-agentflow>=0.10.0`**, the final release of the core under the old
  name. It is the first core release with `interrupt()`, per-run `remote_tools` and
  `validate_skill`. Do not install `10xgraph` in the same environment: both provide the
  `agentflow` module.
- WebSocket connection limits now default to finite values (`max_connections` 1000,
  `max_connections_per_user` 10) instead of unlimited when the key is missing. Set a key to
  `0` or `null` for unlimited. Graph runs started over `/v1/graph/ws` count against the
  global `rate_limit` bucket.
- Project URLs point at [10xgraph.com](https://10xgraph.com) and the 10xGraph organisation.

### Security

- **Server-owned config keys are stripped from client requests.** `authz`, `user`,
  `user_id`, `remote_tools` and `_`-prefixed internal keys in a request's `config` are
  dropped on every route that forwards it to the graph, checkpointer or store. The thread a
  request runs on is the one the permission check approved, normalised on both sides.
- **Client messages can no longer carry tool calls.** Only the model may request a tool; a
  client may send a tool result only as the answer to a remote tool call still waiting for
  one.
- **Document extraction is bounded.** ZIP-based documents are inspected before parsing
  (entry count, total uncompressed size, compression ratio), extraction has a timeout, and
  extracted text is capped.

### Breaking

- **`POST /v1/graph/setup` is removed.** Declare client-executed tools under `remote_tools`
  in `agentflow.json` instead; they are attached at startup.
- **`agentflow config list|get|set|unset|path|validate` are removed**, and stored
  `output.*` preferences are no longer read at startup. Pass `--format`, `--color` and
  `--progress` on the command line instead. `agentflow config` is now the
  `agentflow.json` editor above.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Persistent full-screen application surface.** On an interactive terminal a
  command now runs on its own screen with branded chrome pinned in place: a
  header (gradient rule, identity, version, subtitle) at the top, a footer
  status bar at the bottom, and the command's output scrolling between them.
  Pinning uses a DEC scrolling region, so it survives output from child
  processes — pytest, Uvicorn, Questionary prompts — without routing any of it
  through a renderer. The screen is held until you press Enter, and released
  through a `finally` guard so a crash can never leave your shell on an
  alternate buffer or inside a scrolling region. Opt out with `--no-fullscreen`
  or `AGENTFLOW_NO_FULLSCREEN=1`.
- Full-canvas animated command intro: an eased block-letter `AGENTFLOW` reveal
  with a moving light front, a flowing gradient field, a typed tagline, and a
  per-command pipeline that fills in as the intro plays. Inside the full-screen
  surface it collapses into the pinned header; with `--no-fullscreen` it plays
  on a temporary screen and leaves a durable header in your scrollback.
- Live step timelines (`OutputFormatter.timeline`): a command declares its stages
  up front, so pending work is visible from the first frame while the running
  stage animates with a spinner, elapsed timer, and a live detail line. Wired
  into `play`/`dev`/`api`, `init`, `build`, `test`, and `audit`.
- Determinate progress with a running pass/fail tally
  (`OutputFormatter.progress_run`), used by `agentflow eval` so per-case results
  scroll above a bar that reports completion, counts, and elapsed time.
- Shared brand palette and glyph sets (`cli/core/theme.py`) with continuous
  gradient sampling and a complete ASCII fallback set.
- Command-specific intro signatures and taglines for `play`, `dev`, `api`,
  `init`, `build`, `test`, `eval`, `audit`, and `skills`, previewable with the
  side-effect-free `agentflow demo` (`--style all|typing|network|init|build|eval`).
- Row-by-row reveal for completion panels.
- **Shared guided-prompt layer** (`cli/core/prompts.py`). Every interactive
  question now runs through one themed service, so prompts share a palette, a
  cancellation contract (Ctrl+C returns to a clean exit rather than a
  traceback), and one non-interactive policy.
- `agentflow skills` picks agents with an arrow-key list where **space toggles**
  and enter confirms, instead of typing a menu number. Each row shows its
  install path, already-installed agents are labelled and pre-checked, and
  choosing one that exists offers to overwrite rather than failing.
- `agentflow skills` reports installs through a timeline and a completion
  screen, matching every other command.
- `agentflow init` prompts now explain each option inline — what Quick Start
  versus Production scaffolds, what each auth mode requires, what each rate
  limit backend costs.
- Staged startup feedback, a pre-flight port check, and connected-playground
  completion output for `agentflow play` and `agentflow dev`.
- Adaptive `--animation` / `--no-animation` controls with CI, pipe, JSON, and
  accessibility-safe fallbacks. Every animated surface has a plain
  line-per-transition renderer and a versioned JSON/JSONL event renderer.
- Adaptive Rich terminal rendering with TTY/CI detection, plain/JSONL modes,
  `NO_COLOR` support, ASCII fallback, quiet mode, and shared status rendering.
- Root `--format`, `--json`, `--color`, `--no-color`, `--progress`,
  `--animation/--no-animation`, `--fullscreen/--no-fullscreen`, `--cwd`,
  `--yes`, `--non-interactive`, `--debug`, and `-V/--version` options.
- `agentflow dev` as the goal-oriented local development command (config, host,
  port, `--reload/--no-reload`, `--open/--no-open`); `api` and `play` remain
  available for compatibility.
- `agentflow audit`: six read-only checks — Python interpreter, installed
  `10xscale-agentflow-cli`, installed `10xscale-agentflow`, whether the installed
  core still exposes the evaluation API `agentflow eval` imports, whether
  `agentflow.json` exists and declares a valid `agent` key, and whether the
  default port is free. Reported live through the timeline and again as a summary
  table. Exits `1` on any failure and `0` otherwise (warnings do not fail the
  run), so it works as a CI gate; nothing is written or changed.
- `agentflow demo`: preview the animation, timeline, and progress states without
  touching project state.
- Cross-platform `agentflow config list|get|set|unset|path|validate` user
  preferences, stored as JSON in the per-user config directory. `output.format`,
  `output.color`, and `output.progress` are read at startup as defaults; explicit
  flags still win.
- Reproducible `agentflow init --non-interactive` recipes and `--dry-run` previews.
- Stable CLI error codes and dependency recovery suggestions.
- `py.typed` marker, so type information now reaches consumers (PEP 561).
- `--integration` pytest flag gating tests marked `integration` that require real
  Redis/Postgres, so a default `pytest` run needs no external services.
- mypy configuration (`[tool.mypy]`) and a mypy step in CI.
- CodeQL static analysis workflow.
- Dependabot configuration for pip and GitHub Actions updates.
- Community health files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, issue forms, and a pull request template.
- `Changelog` entry in project URLs.

### Changed

- Command implementations are loaded lazily, so a broken optional feature no longer
  prevents root help, version, completion, or unrelated commands from starting.
- CLI logging now uses one invocation-wide handler, so quiet and verbose levels apply
  consistently without duplicate records.
- Project configuration discovery now walks parent directories from the current
  working directory.
- Init, build, and eval status output now flows through the shared renderer instead of
  writing raw ANSI control sequences.
- **The full-screen session no longer erases the command's output.** It used to
  hold the alternate screen through a Rich live display, which re-homes the
  cursor before every write — so each line overwrote the last — and then released
  the screen on exit, which a terminal handles by discarding everything drawn on
  it. Short commands showed a flash of nothing. The frame now switches the buffer
  directly and pauses on a closing hint before letting go.
- The screen is claimed lazily, by the first command that renders a header.
  Script-shaped invocations (`--version`, `config get`, `--format json`) never
  take over the terminal or pause on exit.
- A console that reports itself as a terminal but refuses the alternate buffer
  (legacy Windows console) now aborts the frame before anything is written,
  rather than leaving a scrolling region on the user's real scrollback.
- **A terminal that cannot host a prompt no longer crashes the command.**
  `stdin.isatty()` is true under MSYS/Cygwin shells on Windows, but
  prompt-toolkit cannot attach to a console there and raises — which surfaced as
  `AF-INTERNAL-001: Unexpected error: Found xterm-256color, while expecting a
  Windows console`. Prompt availability is now probed, so such a terminal counts
  as non-interactive and gets the usual "pass --agent or --all" guidance.
- Pinned chrome is repainted after each prompt. Prompt-toolkit erases from the
  cursor to the end of the *screen*, which reaches past the scrolling region and
  took the footer with it.
- One Rich `Console` is now reused per stream. Rebuilding it per call meant a live
  display could not tell that ordinary prints belonged to it, so background output
  collided with spinners and progress bars instead of scrolling above them.
- `agentflow init` no longer prints one line per scaffolded file; files stream through
  the active timeline row instead.

### Fixed

- **Scaffolding templates were missing from the wheel.** The `package-data` globs only
  matched `*.json/*.yaml/*.yml/*.md/*.txt`, silently dropping
  `templates/dev/.env.example`, `templates/prod/.env.example`,
  `templates/prod/.python-version`, and `templates/prod/pyproject.toml`. `agentflow init`
  failed for anyone installing from PyPI. Packaging now ships the package tree wholesale.
- `agentflow version` reported `unknown` for the package version when installed from a
  wheel, because it read `pyproject.toml` from a path that does not exist in an installed
  distribution. It now resolves from installed distribution metadata and additionally
  reports the core `10xscale-agentflow` version.
- The `prod` template shipped `.pre-commot-config.yaml` (typo), so `pre-commit` found no
  config in scaffolded projects. Renamed to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Branch coverage is now measured by the default `pytest` invocation (`--cov-branch`),
  not only in the CI-specific command.

### Changed

- **Every runtime dependency now has a lower bound**, and pre-1.0 / major-version-risky
  dependencies have an upper cap (`pydantic>=2.13,<3`, `fastapi>=0.116,<1.0`,
  `10xscale-agentflow>=0.9.0,<2.0`, and so on). Previously all runtime dependencies were
  unpinned, so a major release of any of them could break installs without warning.
- Optional extras `snowflakekit`, `redis`, and `jwt` gained bounds.
- CI now runs on pushes to `main` as well as pull requests, and covers both advertised
  Python versions (3.12 and 3.13) rather than 3.13 alone.
- The release workflow now depends on a passing test job; it no longer builds and
  publishes untested code.
- `Documentation` URL points at the published docs site instead of a Read the Docs URL
  that was never provisioned.

### Removed

- `agentflow_cli/src/app/routers/a2a.py` and `a2ui.py`. Both were entirely commented out,
  never mounted by `setup_router.init_routes`, and shipped in the wheel as dead code.
  They can be restored from git history when the A2A surface is actually implemented.
- Design and planning notes from the repository root (`AUTHORIZATION_PLAN.md`,
  `AUTHORIZATION_PLAN_PHASE2.md`, `AGENTFLOW_JSON.md`, `CUSTOM_AUTH.md`).
