# Auth and Authorization

Use this when changing HTTP authentication, authorization, permission checks, scopes, storage
isolation, or client auth examples.

Two independent layers:

- Authentication (`BaseAuth`): who is the caller? Produces a `user` dict.
- Authorization (`AuthorizationBackend`): what may they do, and whose data can they touch?

## Authentication Modes

Default:

- `auth: null`
- No authentication. Local development / trusted gateways only.

JWT:

- `auth: "jwt"`
- Requires `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_ALGORITHM`. Token must carry `user_id` and `exp`.
- Requests use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Decoded payload becomes the `user` context.

Custom:

```json
{ "auth": { "method": "custom", "path": "graph.auth:MyAuthBackend" } }
```

Custom backends subclass `BaseAuth`. `authenticate` is **synchronous** (called without `await`)
and takes three args:

```python
def authenticate(self, request, response, credential) -> dict | None: ...
```

- `request` may be a `Request` or a `WebSocket` (both are `HTTPConnection`) — read
  `request.headers`, do not assume Request-only APIs.
- `credential` is the parsed bearer token (`HTTPAuthorizationCredentials | None`). For
  API-key/cookie schemes, ignore it and read headers directly.
- Return a dict with at least `user_id` (keys flow into `config["user"]`); `{}`/`None` = anonymous;
  raise `UserAccountError`/`HTTPException` to reject (401 HTTP, 1008 close on WebSocket).
- Do NOT declare it `async def` — an un-awaited coroutine breaks auth silently.
- Include `roles` / `scopes` in the returned dict to feed authorization.

## Authorization

Configured via the `authorization` key; separate from `auth`. Values:

- `null` (unset): mode-based default — `"ownership"` in production, `"allow_all"` in development.
- `"ownership"`: owner-only. A thread is readable/runnable/deletable only by its creator; a
  foreign `invoke`/`stream` is rejected up front (403). Enforced on every thread-touching step.
- `"allow_all"` (aliases `"default"`, `"none"`): any authenticated user may do anything.
- `"module:attr"`: custom `AuthorizationBackend`.
- `{ "backend": "rbac", ... }`: role-based access control (below).

Ownership is scalable: ownership is immutable, so it is cached (in-process LRU + optional shared
Redis when `redis`/`REDIS_URL` is set) via `ThreadOwnershipResolver` over
`BaseCheckpointer.aget_thread_owner`. After the first lookup a check is an in-memory hit, not a
per-request DB call; the cache is evicted on thread deletion. Ownership needs a persistent
checkpointer (pg/sqlite/in-memory); with none, requests pass through.

### Custom backend interface

```python
class MyAuthz(AuthorizationBackend):
    async def authorize(
        self, user: dict, resource: str, action: str,
        resource_id: str | None = None, **context,
    ) -> bool: ...                     # required; False -> 403

    def isolation_scope(self) -> str:  # optional; "owner" | "none" (default "none")
        return "owner"

    def scopes_for(self, user: dict) -> list[str] | None:  # optional; None = permissive
        return user.get("scopes")
```

Subclass `OwnershipAuthorizationBackend` to inherit cached owner-only checks and override only
what you need.

### Scopes

Each endpoint requires the scope `"<resource>:<action>"`. `RequirePermission` checks it against
`authz.scopes_for(user)`; `None` = permissive (default, nothing breaks until scopes are issued).

- `graph`: `invoke`, `stream`, `stop`, `fix`, `setup`, `read`
- `checkpointer`: `read`, `write`, `delete`
- `store`: `read`, `write`, `delete`
- `files`: `upload`, `read`
- `config`: `read`

### RBAC config (no code)

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "backend": "rbac",
    "roles": { "admin": ["*"], "member": ["graph:invoke", "checkpointer:read"] },
    "default_scopes": ["graph:read"],
    "isolation": "owner"
  }
}
```

Maps `user["roles"]` to scopes on top of owner isolation. `"*"` -> all scopes. `default_scopes`
granted to everyone. `isolation`: `"owner"` | `"none"`.

### Data isolation (config["authz"])

API checks decide access; the storage layer (checkpointer, store) enforces isolation from a
trusted policy. After a successful check, `RequirePermission` stamps
`user["authz"] = {user_id, scope, scopes}` where `scope` = backend `isolation_scope()`. Services
copy the trusted `user` into `config["user"]`, so the core library reads `config["user"]["authz"]`
and scopes rows to the caller (`owner`) or not (`none`). Set server-side only — not client-forgeable.

## Guarantees

- Routes are guarded by construction: `assert_all_routes_protected` refuses to boot if any
  non-public route lacks `RequirePermission`. Public: `/ping` and dev-only eval endpoints.
- Return 401 for auth failure, 403 for authorization/scope failure.

## TypeScript Client

```typescript
const client = new AgentFlowClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});
```

## Rules

- No unauthenticated API mode in production unless a trusted gateway handles auth.
- Keep `authenticate` synchronous; keep authorization out of graph business logic.
- Sanitize logging for tokens and user payloads.
- Update the scope catalog and permission tables when adding routes.
