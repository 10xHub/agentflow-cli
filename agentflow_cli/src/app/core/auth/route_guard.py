"""Boot-time invariant: every route must go through the authorization layer.

Authorization is applied per-handler via ``Depends(RequirePermission(...))``, which is
precise (each endpoint declares its own resource/action) but easy to forget on a new
endpoint -- and a forgotten guard ships an open endpoint. This module makes that failure
happen at startup instead: :func:`assert_all_routes_protected` refuses to boot if any
non-public route lacks a ``RequirePermission`` dependency.

It adds zero per-request cost and turns "someone forgot the guard" into a loud deploy-time
error rather than a silent production hole.
