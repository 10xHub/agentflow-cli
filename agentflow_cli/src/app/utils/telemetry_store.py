"""In-memory telemetry store for observability.

Captures per-run streaming records (one per ``StreamChunk``) keyed by thread, so
the observability endpoint can reconstruct a trace (spans + events + token cost)
from the events a run actually emitted. This is process-local and best-effort —
it is not a durable telemetry backend; restart clears it.

A single instance is bound as an InjectQ singleton and written to by the graph
service during invoke/stream runs.
