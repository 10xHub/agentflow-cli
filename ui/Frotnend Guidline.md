Goal of the project:
We aim to create a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of managing and interacting with our API, ultimately enhancing the user experience and increasing productivity, it will be same a langchain studio
or same as chatgpt ui

Where left side panel contains the conversation history and the right side panel is for the current chat.
Top right corner will have the user profile and settings options
where options are
1. State -> It will fetch data from the API, and show whats in the current state -> it will open right panel
2. Memory -> Current Memory for that user
3. Setup -> It will open a dialog for setting up the API connection and auth tokens
4. Reset -> It will reset the current conversation and clear the context
5. Events -> All the realtime events


Leftside -> It will show the conversation history and allow users to switch between different chats and start new chats options

Rightside -> It will show the current chat and allow users to interact with the API
